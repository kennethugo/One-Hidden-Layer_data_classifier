Data Classification with One Hidden Layer neural network

This implements a two class classification neural network with a single hidden layer, using non-linear activation function, such as tanh, computing the cross entropy loss and Implementing forward and backward propagation, this implements a two class classification neural network with a single hidden layer, using non-linear activation function, such as tanh, computing the cross entropy loss and Implementing forward and backward propagation
